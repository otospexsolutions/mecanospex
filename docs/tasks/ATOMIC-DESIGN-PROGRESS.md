# Atomic Design Refactor Progress

Started: 2025-12-01T11:40:00Z

## Phase 1: Setup - [x]
Created directory structure:
- components/atoms/
- components/molecules/
- components/organisms/
- components/templates/

## Phase 2: Categorize - [x]

### Component Inventory & Categorization

#### Atoms (smallest building blocks)
- [x] LoadingSpinner → atoms/Spinner/

#### Molecules (combinations of atoms)
- [x] SearchInput → molecules/SearchInput/
- [x] FilterTabs → molecules/FilterTabs/
- [x] Tabs → molecules/Tabs/
- [x] Breadcrumb → molecules/Breadcrumb/

#### Organisms (complex UI sections)
- [x] TopBar → organisms/TopBar/
- [x] Sidebar → organisms/Sidebar/
- [x] CompanySelector → organisms/CompanySelector/
- [x] LocationSelector → organisms/LocationSelector/
- [x] AddLocationModal → organisms/AddLocationModal/
- [x] AddCompanyModal → organisms/AddCompanyModal/

#### Templates (page layouts)
- [x] Layout → templates/DashboardLayout/

#### Feature-Specific (keep in features/)
- RequirePermission → features/auth/components/
- DocumentLineEditor → features/documents/components/
- AuthProvider → features/auth/
- CompanyProvider → features/company/
- LocationProvider → features/location/
- All Page components → features/*/pages/

## Phase 3: Atoms - [x]
Completed:
- LoadingSpinner → atoms/Spinner/

## Phase 4: Molecules - [x]
Completed:
- SearchInput → molecules/SearchInput/
- FilterTabs → molecules/FilterTabs/
- Tabs → molecules/Tabs/
- Breadcrumb → molecules/Breadcrumb/

## Phase 5: Organisms - [x]
Completed:
- TopBar → organisms/TopBar/
- Sidebar → organisms/Sidebar/
- CompanySelector → organisms/CompanySelector/
- LocationSelector → organisms/LocationSelector/
- AddLocationModal → organisms/AddLocationModal/
- AddCompanyModal → organisms/AddCompanyModal/

## Phase 6: Templates - [x]
Completed:
- Layout → templates/DashboardLayout/

## Phase 7: Features - [x]
Verified feature-specific components remain in features/:
- AuthProvider → features/auth/
- LoginPage → features/auth/
- CompanyProvider → features/company/
- LocationProvider → features/location/
- AddCompanyModal, AddLocationModal, LocationSelector → Re-export from organisms for backwards compatibility

## Phase 8: Imports - [x]
All existing imports work via backwards compatibility re-exports:
- Old component paths re-export from new atomic locations
- Build verified successfully
## Phase 9: Verify - [x]

Final verification completed:
- Build passes successfully (1919 modules transformed)
- All barrel exports in place (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- Backwards compatibility verified - all existing imports work
- No breaking changes introduced

## Summary

### New Component Structure
```
components/
├── atoms/
│   └── Spinner/
├── molecules/
│   ├── SearchInput/
│   ├── FilterTabs/
│   ├── Tabs/
│   └── Breadcrumb/
├── organisms/
│   ├── TopBar/
│   ├── Sidebar/
│   ├── CompanySelector/
│   ├── LocationSelector/
│   ├── AddCompanyModal/
│   └── AddLocationModal/
├── templates/
│   └── DashboardLayout/
├── ui/          (backwards compat re-exports)
└── layout/      (backwards compat re-exports)
```

### Backwards Compatibility
Old import paths continue to work via re-exports:
- `components/ui/SearchInput` → re-exports from `molecules/SearchInput`
- `components/layout/Sidebar` → re-exports from `organisms/Sidebar`
- `components/layout/Layout` → re-exports from `templates/DashboardLayout`
- etc.

### Feature-Specific Components (unchanged)
- `features/auth/` - AuthProvider, LoginPage
- `features/company/` - CompanyProvider
- `features/location/` - LocationProvider
- `features/documents/` - DocumentLineEditor, etc.
